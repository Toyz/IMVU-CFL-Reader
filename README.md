# IMVU-CFL-Reader
Basic CFL reader and converter for IMVU

This tool let's you convert CFL files from IMVUs old editor to CHKNs the new file type (Just a zip file really).

The tool is super basic right now and requires a little bit of python understanding but will be updated soon to have a basic interface and more...


How to use: python main.pt cflfile ( EX: python main.py test.cfl )
